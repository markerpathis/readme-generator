  ## Installation
  In order to use this application the user needs to install Node dependencies with npm, by running the following command in their command-line - “npm install”.
  
  ## Usage
  Once the dependencies are installed, the user can use the command line to start answering the inquirer prompts by entering the following command - “node index.js”. The user will need to answer all 9 prompts before the README is generated. A video walkthrough of the command-line application being used is included in the assets folder of this repository.
